      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); //shallow copy

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players); //shallow copy

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]; //shallow copy

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      console.log(captain);
      // captain.number = 99
      // console.log(captain);
      // console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 }); //take blank object, overwrite with object you want, edit/add what you want
      console.log(cap2);
      console.log(person);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.status = "open";
      cap3.name = "Jeff";
      console.log(cap3);
      console.log(person);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
